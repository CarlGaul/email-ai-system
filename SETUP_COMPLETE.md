tail -f ~/Desktop/EmailAI/logs/stderr.log

# View output logs
tail -f ~/Desktop/EmailAI/logs/stdout.log
```

### **Manual Testing**
```bash
# Test with dummy data
python3 test_email_ai.py

# Test with real data
python3 email_ai.py
```

## 🚀 Advanced Features (Ready for Implementation)

### **Legal AI Integration**
The system is designed to integrate with your LegalAI system. To add legal analysis:

1. Import LegalBERT models from your LegalAI setup
2. Add legal analysis to the `process_email()` function
3. Flag emails for pregnancy discrimination or other legal issues

### **Urgent Alerts**
For immediate high-priority notifications:
1. Modify the main script to detect high-priority emails
2. Send separate urgent alerts instead of waiting for daily reports
3. Implement real-time monitoring if needed

### **Custom Prompts**
Edit the `process_email()` function to customize:
- Summary style and length
- Priority classification criteria
- Response drafting tone and approach

## 🔒 Security Notes

- All processing happens locally on your machine
- Email credentials stored as environment variables
- No data sent to external services (except your email providers)
- Consider using a dedicated config file for production use

## 📞 Support and Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Environment Variables Not Set**: Run `python3 setup_env.py`
2. **Ollama Not Running**: Start with `ollama serve`
3. **IMAP Connection Failures**: Check credentials and server settings
4. **Service Not Loaded**: Run `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.emailai.daily.plist`

### **Getting Help:**
